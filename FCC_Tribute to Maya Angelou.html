        <p>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.</p>
        <p>I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size</p>
        <p>But when I start to tell them, They think I’m telling lies.</p>
        <p>I say,</p>
        <p>It’s in the reach of my arms,</p>
        <p>The span of my hips,</p>
        <p>The stride of my step,</p>
        <p>The curl of my lips.</p>
        <p> I’m a woman Phenomenally.</p>
        <p>Phenomenal woman, That’s me. </p>
